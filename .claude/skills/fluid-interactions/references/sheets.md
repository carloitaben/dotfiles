# Sheets

A bottom sheet with detents (for example closed, half, full). The sheet's `y` is the distance from the top of the screen to its top edge.

```ts
const FULL = screenHeight * 0.1;
const HALF = screenHeight * 0.4;
const CLOSED = screenHeight - peekHeight; // handle + search field + margin
const DETENTS = [FULL, HALF, CLOSED];

const drag = useDrag({
  onStart: () => {
    y.stop();
    origin.current = y.get();
  },
  onMove: (delta) => {
    y.set(
      applyRubberBand(origin.current + delta.y, FULL, CLOSED, screenHeight),
    );
  },
  onEnd: (velocity) => {
    const landing = y.get() + project(velocity.y * 0.75);
    const target = nearest(landing, DETENTS);
    setDetent(target); // state only on release
    animate(y, target, { ...spring(SHEET), velocity: velocity.y });
  },
});
```

- **Project before snapping,** so a quick flick from closed can skip half and land on full. The `0.75` damps the projection because detents are close together.
- **Rubber band past both ends.** Pulling above full or below closed resists instead of hard-stopping. Make the sheet taller than the screen so the rubber band never shows its bottom edge.
- **State only on release or button press.** The current detent is state (it changes what renders); the sheet's position is a motion value.
- **Buttons that change detent** use the same spring without a velocity.

## The background

Derive it from `y` with transforms, so it tracks the drag for free:

```ts
const dim = useTransform(y, [FULL, HALF], [0.06, 0]);
const backgroundScale = useTransform(
  y,
  [FULL, HALF],
  [reduceMotion ? 1 : 0.92, 1],
);
```

Under reduced motion keep the dim but drop the scale; see [reduced motion](reduced-motion.md).

At the top detent, make the dimmed background tappable: a tap there closes the sheet, with the same spring the detent buttons use. Below the top detent, leave the background alone (`pointer-events: none` on the dim) so the map or page underneath still works.

## Content that scrolls

- **Drag from the handle.** Give the handle a full-width hit area with generous padding (the bar itself is only about 5px tall).
- **Only let the list scroll at full.** At lower detents use `overflow: hidden`, otherwise a drag inside the list is ambiguous between scrolling and moving the sheet.
- **Give the list a fixed height** (the visible height at full, minus the handle and header) and `overscroll-behavior: contain`, so reaching the end doesn't scroll the page.
- **Safari leaves a flex column's bottom padding out of its scroll height.** Add a spacer element at the end of the list instead of `padding-bottom`.
